# Configuration for dense urban environments
# Examples: Tokyo, New York, London, Paris, Hong Kong

name: "Dense City"
description: "High POI density, excellent transit, fine-grained spatial analysis"

# H3 Hexagon Resolution
# Resolution 9: ~175m edge, ~0.1 kmÂ² area (city block scale)
h3:
  primary_resolution: 9
  fallback_resolution: 8  # Wider corridors if res 9 too sparse

# HDBSCAN Clustering Parameters
clustering:
  min_cluster_size: 12  # Require at least 12 POIs per neighborhood cluster
  min_samples: 3        # Core points need 3+ neighbors
  cluster_selection_epsilon: 0.0  # No distance threshold override
  max_clusters: 10      # Alert if more than 10 clusters found (over-segmentation)
  min_clusters: 2       # Alert if fewer than 2 clusters (under-segmentation)

# Search Parameters
search:
  default_radius_m: 4000     # 4km search radius
  max_candidates: 120        # Fetch up to 120 places
  
# Routing Defaults
routing:
  preferred_mode: "TRANSIT"          # Dense cities have robust public transport
  routing_preference: "TRAFFIC_AWARE"  # Use traffic data
  min_eta_seconds: 180              # Minimum 3 min between stops
  service_time_minutes: 35          # Average dwell time per stop

# Scoring Weights (can be overridden by A/B variants)
scoring:
  w_rating: 0.30       # High-quality experiences
  w_diversity: 0.25    # Variety within neighborhoods
  w_eta: 0.20          # Travel time (less critical with transit)
  w_open: 0.15         # Availability
  w_crowd: 0.10        # Prefer less touristy spots

# Time Windows
time:
  default_start_hour: 10    # 10 AM default start
  default_end_hour: 20      # 8 PM default end
  max_stops_per_day: 8      # Maximum stops in one day
