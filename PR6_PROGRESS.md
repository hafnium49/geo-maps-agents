# PR #6: CI/CD & Testing Infrastructure - Progress Report

**Date**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (~20% complete)  
**PR Version**: v0.6.0

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Test Infrastructure Foundation
- ✅ Created `tests/` directory structure
- ✅ Created `tests/fixtures/` for mock API responses  
- ✅ Configured `pytest.ini` with test discovery, markers, and ROS plugin workarounds
- ✅ Configured `.coveragerc` for coverage reporting (target >80%)

### 2. Pytest Fixtures and Mocks (tests/conftest.py - 192 lines)
- ✅ Sample places data fixtures
- ✅ Sample distance matrices  
- ✅ Sample ETAs and time windows
- ✅ Mock Places API client (returns fixtures instead of real API calls)
- ✅ Mock Routes API client (returns fixtures instead of real API calls)
- ✅ Test environment setup (dummy API keys)
- ✅ Utility functions (DataFrame comparison, approx equality)

### 3. Mock API Fixtures
- ✅ `tests/fixtures/places_api.json` (180 lines)
  - nearbySearch responses (restaurants, museums, parks)
  - placeDetails responses
  - textSearch responses
  - Edge cases (no results, no ratings, no hours)
  
- ✅ `tests/fixtures/routes_api.json` (130 lines)
  - computeRoutes responses (short, medium, long)
  - computeRouteMatrix responses (3x3, 5x5 matrices)
  - Traffic condition variants
  - Edge cases (not found, zero distance, matrix errors)

### 4. Unit Tests - Scoring Module (tests/test_scoring.py - 455 lines)
**30 tests, all passing! ✅**

#### Normalization Tests (11 tests)
- ✅ Percentile-based normalization (basic, inverted, edge cases)
- ✅ Rating normalization (typical values, low ratings, NaN handling)
- ✅ ETA normalization (typical, minimum clamping, very short times)

#### Weight Configuration Tests (5 tests)  
- ✅ Default weights validation
- ✅ Custom weights creation
- ✅ Weight serialization (to_dict)
- ✅ A/B variant selection (deterministic, distribution)

#### PlaceScorer Tests (11 tests)
- ✅ Scorer initialization
- ✅ Basic scoring pipeline
- ✅ Telemetry logging and clearing
- ✅ User preference multipliers
- ✅ Diversity gain calculation
- ✅ Custom weights application

#### Edge Cases (3 tests)
- ✅ Empty DataFrame handling
- ✅ Missing ETAs handling
- ✅ All closed places handling

## 🔜 Next Steps

### Phase 1: Complete Unit Tests (~40% of PR)
- ⏳ **tests/test_spatial.py** (200-250 lines)
  - Test H3 aggregation (aggregate_to_h3, hex validation)
  - Test HDBSCAN clustering with fallbacks
  - Test silhouette score calculations
  - Test cluster labeling
  
- ⏳ **tests/test_routing.py** (250-300 lines)

  - Test greedy_sequence algorithm
  - Test solve_vrptw (OR-Tools solver)
  - Test solve_vrptw_with_fallback (automatic switching)

  - Cache uv dependencies

### Phase 4: Documentation (~10% of PR)
- ⏳ Update **README.md** with testing section
- ⏳ Create **TESTING.md** (optional)
- ⏳ Update **CHANGELOG.md** with v0.6.0 release

### Phase 5: Verification (~5% of PR)
- ⏳ Create **verify_pr6.py** (300-400 lines)
  - Check test structure (8+ checks)
  - Run pytest and verify >80% coverage
  - Check CI workflow exists
  - Validate mock fixtures
  - Final summary report

## 📝 Technical Notes

### pytest Configuration Challenges
- ROS pytest plugins (launch_testing_ros, ament_*) conflicted with our tests
- **Solution**: Disabled ROS plugins in pytest.ini with `-p no:*` flags
- **Alternative**: Use `PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1` environment variable

### Test Fixture Organization
- Shared fixtures in `tests/conftest.py` for reusability
- Module-specific fixtures can be defined in test files
- Mock API clients return fixture data instead of making real API calls

### Test Markers
- `@pytest.mark.unit` - Fast, isolated tests
- `@pytest.mark.integration` - Multi-component tests
- `@pytest.mark.slow` - Tests that may take >1 second
- `@pytest.mark.ortools` - Tests using OR-Tools solver (optional)

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] >80% code coverage across `src/` modules
- [ ] All tests passing in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Mock fixtures for all external APIs
- [ ] Documentation updated with testing instructions
- [ ] verify_pr6.py passes all checks (8/8)
