# Configuration for suburban environments
# Examples: Silicon Valley suburbs, outer London boroughs, Tokyo suburbs

name: "Suburban"
description: "Medium POI density, car-dependent, wider spatial grouping"

# H3 Hexagon Resolution
# Resolution 8: ~461m edge, ~0.74 kmÂ² area (neighborhood scale)
h3:
  primary_resolution: 8
  fallback_resolution: 7  # Even wider if needed

# HDBSCAN Clustering Parameters
clustering:
  min_cluster_size: 8   # Fewer POIs per cluster (spread out)
  min_samples: 2        # Lower density threshold
  cluster_selection_epsilon: 0.0
  max_clusters: 8       # Suburban areas have fewer distinct zones
  min_clusters: 2

# Search Parameters
search:
  default_radius_m: 8000     # 8km search radius (car-friendly)
  max_candidates: 100        # Slightly fewer total options
  
# Routing Defaults
routing:
  preferred_mode: "DRIVE"              # Cars are primary transport
  routing_preference: "TRAFFIC_AWARE"  # Traffic matters for driving
  min_eta_seconds: 300                # 5 min minimum (longer distances)
  service_time_minutes: 40            # Slightly longer stops (parking time)

# Scoring Weights
scoring:
  w_rating: 0.35       # Quality more important (fewer options)
  w_diversity: 0.20    # Less emphasis on variety
  w_eta: 0.25          # Travel time matters more (driving)
  w_open: 0.12         # Availability
  w_crowd: 0.08        # Crowds less of an issue

# Time Windows
time:
  default_start_hour: 9     # 9 AM start (later opening hours)
  default_end_hour: 19      # 7 PM end (earlier closing)
  max_stops_per_day: 6      # Fewer stops (longer travel)
