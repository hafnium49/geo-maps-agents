# Configuration for rural/sparse environments
# Examples: National parks, countryside, small towns, coastal areas

name: "Rural"
description: "Low POI density, long distances, minimal clustering"

# H3 Hexagon Resolution
# Resolution 7: ~1.22km edge, ~5.16 kmÂ² area (regional scale)
h3:
  primary_resolution: 7
  fallback_resolution: 6  # Very wide coverage

# HDBSCAN Clustering Parameters
clustering:
  min_cluster_size: 5   # Even smaller clusters acceptable
  min_samples: 1        # Very low density threshold
  cluster_selection_epsilon: 0.0
  max_clusters: 5       # Few distinct areas
  min_clusters: 1       # Even single cluster acceptable (fallback to scoring)

# Search Parameters
search:
  default_radius_m: 20000    # 20km search radius (wide net)
  max_candidates: 80         # Fewer total POIs available
  
# Routing Defaults
routing:
  preferred_mode: "DRIVE"              # Car essential in rural areas
  routing_preference: "TRAFFIC_UNAWARE"  # Less traffic concern
  min_eta_seconds: 600                # 10 min minimum (long distances)
  service_time_minutes: 45            # Longer stops (destination-focused)

# Scoring Weights
scoring:
  w_rating: 0.40       # Quality paramount (very limited options)
  w_diversity: 0.15    # Diversity less feasible
  w_eta: 0.30          # Travel time critical (long drives)
  w_open: 0.10         # Limited hours
  w_crowd: 0.05        # Crowds rarely an issue

# Time Windows
time:
  default_start_hour: 9     # 9 AM start
  default_end_hour: 17      # 5 PM end (early closing common)
  max_stops_per_day: 4      # Few stops (long distances)
